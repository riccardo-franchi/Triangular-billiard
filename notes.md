# notes
- Every point can be described as a vector with four components ($\mathbb{R}^4$), two of them describing the position and two the velocity:
$$(x_i, y_i, v_{x_i}, v_{y_i})$$

- We don't have to consider the mass of the particles, as we are consiering no friction


### equations

- Equation of the upper edge:
$$ y = \frac{r_2 - r_1}{l}\ x + r_1$$
- Equation of the lower edge:
$$ y = -\frac{r_2 - r_1}{l}\ x - r_1$$

- Initial trajectory of the particle
$$y = \frac{v_y}{v_x}\ x + y_0$$
with $v_x$, $v_y$ components of the initial velocity and $y_0$ initial position of the particle ($x_0 =0$).
