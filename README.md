# Analysis of the dynamics in a triangular billiard

Our final project for the course "Programmazione per la fisica", at Bologna University.

A description of our system can be found [here](https://github.com/Programmazione-per-la-Fisica/progetto2022/blob/27dd3444af713af519e14dd389d1b2571b29e9e3/biliardo.md).
All mathematical equation used in our code are written up in [equations.md](equations.md).

|   `b`   | set the parameters of the billiard, if you don't select this option default parameters (5, 3, 13) will be used                               |
|   `g`   | generate a sample of N particles and run the simulation                                                                                      |
|   `r`   | read the sample particles from a file and run the simulation                                                                                 |
|   `s`   | compute and print statistics onscreen                                                                                                        |
|   `f`   | compute and save statistics on a file                                                                                                        |
|   `p`   | save the final coordinates of each particle on a file                                                                                        |
|   `x`   | run multiple simulations increasing billiard's length l with fixed step, with the same particle sample, and save result statistics on a file |
|   `h`   | print list of commands                                                                                                                       |
